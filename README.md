Small apps for the Nokia 9000/9110 Communicator
===============================================

This is a collection of small freeware apps written for the Nokia 9000/9110 Communicator (which can probably claim the title of the first true "smartphone" on the market).

The apps themselves are mostly of historical interest, to document the idiosyncratic "GEOS Object C" (GOC) dialect that was used for programming this device.

  - Details on each of the apps, as well as some screenshots, can be found on www.mgroeber.de/nokia.htm.
  - See [github.com/bluewaysw/pcgeos](github.combluewaysw/pcgeos) for the open-sourced version of the GEOS operating system used by the Nokia Communicator 9000/9110 series.
